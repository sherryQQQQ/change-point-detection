# Change Point Detection

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing change point detection algorithms.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the analysis

## Features
- Summary of Change Point Detection Analysis
- We analyzed two datasets (data_5 and data_80) using a window size of 4 for both.
- We generated predictions for both datasets and saved the results to CSV files.
- We calculated performance metrics including MSE and standard deviation for both datasets.
- We visualized the data with and without change points, as well as the deviation patterns.
The analysis helps us understand how well our prediction model performs and where potential change points occur in the time series data.
